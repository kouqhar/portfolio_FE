# About Me :octocat:

Hi! I am Naphtali Duniya! A passionate and pragmatic Full-Stack developer with experience building websites and web applications. Over the years of learning, practice, and teaching, I've learned to be a more independent developer who can flip a problem with a solution, use the help of search engines, stack overflow, team of developers, communities and any other means of finding a solution to a problem. I work with JavaScript and have comfortable knowledge with Bootstrap, jQuery. Also, experience working with Html5, Css3, Scss, Git, GitHub, ReactJs, Express, MongoDb and NodeJs.

My mission is to make coding and web development accessible and flexible to everyone through knowledgeable contents that are simple to digest, and also practical to implement.
